# ZeroShotTransform

Transforms for captioned images.

For now, will include two useful examples I use for training DALLE-pytorch.
I'm interested in kickstarting the learning for zero shot style transfer 
by training with transforms that encourage the zero shot style transfer 
text-image abilities shown off in the DALL-E paper/blog post.

## Two Panel Style Transfer
 ```python
from zero_shot_transform.transforms import zero_shot_transform

# Load an image with PIL
image_file = pathlib.Path("path/to/valid/image.(png|jpg)")
pil_image = PIL.Image.open(image_file)
```

Supported Transform by Name
  - `solarized`
  - `sharpen`
  - `blur`
  - `color_jitter`
  - `grayscale`
  - horizontal_flip
  - vertical_flip

Running 
```python
two_panel_pil_image, two_panel_caption = zero_shot_transform(image, caption="", p=0.5, transform_to_apply="grayscale")
```

Will give you a PIL image somewhat like this.

As well as a caption in the format:
The caption format was generated by copilot using

`Initial phrase`: "Two panel image of the exact same picture."


```python
    f"Two panel image of the exact same picture." + \
    "On the top {caption} and on the bottom the same image but with {transform_name} applied." + \
    "The original image is on the top and the {transform_name} image on the bottom. The caption is {caption}."
```
Transform names have their `_` replaced with spaces.
